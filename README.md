## Tasks
1. üõ† Tech: 
    - [x] ReactJS
    - [x] Redux
    - [x] Redux-Persist
2. Data source: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
    - The provided endpoint loads data in bulk. The app would be slow if it needs to load all the data for every view. One solution is to load data only once when the app loads, store it in state, and use it from there. However, this could create discrepancies if data is updated on the server. Another solution would be to display stored data initially, but still fetch from server for every view. Then, when new data is fetched from the server, update the UI (if needed). I chose the first solution, considering the data source remains unchanged and the endpoint returns all the app data.
    - [x] Use local data (for backup if api fails)
    - [x] Fetch data
    - [x] Store in Redux
3. UI
    - [x] Albums list view  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...) - actions - open album
    - [x] Single album view 
    - [x] Favorites album view
    - [x] Album card component - image, name
    - [x] Photo card component - image, title - actions - add/remove favorite 
    - [x] Layout - header, menu, main sections
    - [x] Menu - üçî opens from hamburger icon on small screens, fixed position on larger screens
4. üíõ Favorites 
    - [x] Actions - add, remove fav
    - [x] Data stored in Redux State
    - [x] Persist favorites after page reload (restart?)
5. üöÄ Deploy 
    - [x] Static github page
    - [x] üêõ 404 after page refresh on routes (only if deployed, locally working) - caused by github pages not supporting client-side routing well - switched from createBrowserRouter to createHashRouter
    - [x] üêõ Error page not loading after switch to createHashRouter
6. ü¶ã Styles - make it look good!
    - [x] Photos list responsive
